## Summary

<!-- One paragraph: what are you proposing and what problem does it solve? -->

## Innovation Checklist

*All 8 items must be answered before this request will be considered.*

- [ ] **Real demand** — Is there demonstrated, real-world demand for this? (Provide evidence, not assumptions.)
- [ ] **Recurrent demand** — Is this need recurrent, not a one-time or edge-case requirement?
- [ ] **Attack surface** — What new attack surface does this introduce? (Document it below.)
- [ ] **Axiom compliance** — Have you verified this against all 50 axioms? Does it violate any?
- [ ] **No custody** — Does this require custody of user funds? (If yes, it is rejected per A0-12.)
- [ ] **Auditable** — Is every step of the decision path auditable retroactively?
- [ ] **Safe failure** — Does it fail safely if something goes wrong?
- [ ] **Isolatable** — Can it be disabled without affecting the rest of the system?
